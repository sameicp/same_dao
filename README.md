# SAME FUTURE DAO

- this code was writen mainly to grasp the concepts of Motoko in great detail.
- the project was done with the help of [Motoko Bootcamp](https://www.motokobootcamp.com/) and some of their videos on Youtube
- I also made use of the Motoko documentation to understand some of the implementation done.
- You can find the documentation [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)

NB. This DAO was created only for learning purposes
